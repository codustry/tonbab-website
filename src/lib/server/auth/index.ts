/**
 * D1 + Better Auth date binding workaround.
 *
 * Better Auth's adapter factory passes JS Date objects directly to the
 * Drizzle driver for any field declared as `type: "date"` (e.g.
 * `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `expiresAt`). Cloudflare D1's binding layer
 * only accepts string / number / boolean / null / Uint8Array — it rejects
 * Date with `D1_TYPE_ERROR: Type 'object' not supported`.
 *
 * `databaseHooks` won't help here because the transform layer runs AFTER
 * hooks and converts ISO strings back to Date objects (see
 * @better-auth/core/db/adapter/factory.mjs `transformInput`).
 *
 * The fix: proxy the D1 database so `prepare(sql).bind(...args)` swaps
 * any Date in `args` for its ISO string form before Cloudflare sees it.
 * Same effect for `D1PreparedStatement.bind`.

       * Session cookie name — deliberately WITHOUT a `__Host-` prefix.
       *
       * ## Why not `__Host-` (issue #120)
       *
       * Better Auth composes the final name as an unconditional
       * concatenation (`cookies/index.mjs`):
       *
       *     name: `${secureCookiePrefix}${name}`
       *
       * where `secureCookiePrefix` is `"__Secure-"` in production. It does
       * not check whether the configured name already carries a prefix, so
       * `"__Host-khaopad_session"` shipped as
       * `__Secure-__Host-khaopad_session`.
       *
       * Per RFC 6265bis §4.1.3.2 a prefix only carries its guarantees when
       * it is the LEADING prefix. With `__Secure-` in front, `__Host-`
       * becomes an ordinary part of the name and browsers enforce nothing.
       * Verified on the deployed demo: a cookie named
       * `__Secure-__Host-probe` was accepted WITH a `Domain` attribute,
       * while a correctly-named `__Host-probe` with `Domain` was refused.
       *
       * So the old config bought no subdomain protection while looking
       * like it did — the worst of both.
       *
       * ## What we do instead
       *
       * Let Better Auth own the prefix. It emits `__Secure-khaopad_session`
       * in production, which browsers DO enforce (Secure-only transport).
       *
       * The attributes below then supply `__Host-`-equivalent hardening
       * ourselves: `path: "/"` and no `Domain` (crossSubDomainCookies stays
       * disabled, so Better Auth never sets one). The only thing not
       * browser-enforced is the "no subdomain may overwrite this name"
       * guarantee — which matters solely if this deployment ever gains
       * sibling subdomains on the registrable domain.
       *
       * Getting real `__Host-` enforcement needs an upstream Better Auth
       * change (skip the prefix when the name already has one), or writing
       * the Set-Cookie header by hand. Tracked in #120.
